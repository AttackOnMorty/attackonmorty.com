## Introduction

I am a full-stack developer who mainly uses React and .NET.

## System Setup

### Trackpad

Throw away your mouse and use the trackpad. It is much more efficient.

- Increase `Tracking Speed` to **maximum**
- Switch `Lookup & data detectors` to `Tap with three fingers`
- Enable `Tap to click`
- Switch `Dragging style` to `Three-Finger Drag`

### Spaces

- Add multiple spaces and assign apps to the desired space
- Disable `Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use`

### Dock

You don't need the dock. Hide it to get more screen space:

- Enable `Automatically hide and show the Dock`
- Switch `Position on screen` to `Left`

> Use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) to launch apps and `command + tab/~` to switch apps.

### Others

- Enable `Reduce motion`
- Unlock with Apple Watch (Optional)
